				<h3>THE STORY</h3>
				<p>[Andrea]<br><br>

Just to set up the back story a bit, Jason and I were reaching our six month anniversary and I told him that I wanted to go all out and celebrate that mile marker because that marks my longest relationship. He happily agreed and I told him I wanted it to be a surprise so whatever he planned to keep a secret. A week went by and as we're approaching our anniversary date, Jason tells me he thinks he wants to push back our celebration to another weekend. I didn't understand why he was pushing it back so much, nothing was making sense but I was trying to be understanding so I complied. After talking and debating with him and realizing that the following three weekends still for whatever reason weren't going to work for him to plan something, I came up with a solution. I offered the idea that we would split up our plans for each other into two weekends simply because I didn't know when the heck he was going to plan something and I wanted to celebrate on the actual six month date. So that seemed to make both of us happy, taking the pressure off Jason to plan something and me getting to plan a nice surprise of Napa Valley Wine tasting at a Castle! <br><br>

A few weeks past our six month, Jason finally chose a weekend to celebrate and I so was excited! I kept going back in my head to how awesome my weekend I planned for us was and knew that whatever he planned was going to be better. I had high expectations to say the least. Finally the day came and as Jason was on his way to pick me up he let me know that nothing he planned was really set in stone for anything and that we may even just sit at my apartment and watch a movie. This wasn't what I was expecting to hear, but I was willing to go along with what he planned since it was his plans. Then he calls me again to tell me that there is a ton of traffic, so he's not even sure when he will be at my place. This day was not turning out how I thought it was, the sun was being covered by nasty bay fog and my bright hopes of a romantic adventure were dissipating. <br><br>

An hour later Jason picked me up and I wasn't really a happy camper at that point. From the sounds of it, he hadn't really planned anything special and was just flying by the seat of his pants. Adding on top of my bad mood was the car sickness that overcame me as we are driving up the side of a mountain to find a nice look out spot. Jason pulls over to what looks like a good view to hike out on and after much convincing, I finally get out of the car to hike out to the edge in the cold fog. We get out to the edge and it's actually pretty enjoyable to my surprise and I started to come out of my bad mood, Jason was right that some fresh air would do me good. At this point we are nuzzled out on a big rock when Jason offers to go back to the car to get a blanket, I kept wanting to go back with him but he assures me he will be right back, so I waited. He brought back this nasty big dirty blanket that he got out of his parents garage (sorry Gwen), but I wrapped it around me anyways.<br><br>

So- at this point I was super nervous and I wasn't sure when I should propose as the plans were not going as "planned." I started to talk about how stoked I was that I met her and that God had been so good to us. I started to discuss one of our first dates where I brought her to a similar spot on the coast and we watched the sunset. This day was definitely nothing like that... It was so cloudy that you couldn't even tell it was 3pm. I realized that I was just filling stuff to talk about because I was so nervous. Andrea started talking about how she was excited to try on Cara's dress (she ended up using one of my good friend's wife's dress). She mentioned immediately following that she couldn't because we weren't engaged. I then said that we should make a firm date, but that I had a question I first needed to ask her. I got the ring out of my pocket and turned around and knelt on the rock in front of her and popped the question! She immediately snatched the ring from me, put it on, and started crying. It was adorable!!! She was so cute. That was it! we are getting married. Lucky! you got invited! or maybe not.</p>
